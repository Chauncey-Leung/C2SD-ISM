# Hardware Parameter Settings

This section describes the **LabVIEW parameter settings** and the corresponding **camera software (HCImageLive)** parameters that align with the LabVIEW configuration.

We also include **Table 1**, which explains the meanings of various parameters on the **LabVIEW front panel**. For details on the camera software parameters, please refer to the official documentation of the Hamamatsu camera:
